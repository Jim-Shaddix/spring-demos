The first \"q\" parameter (if any) separates the media-range parameter(s) from the accept-params. Quality factors allow the user or user agent to indicate the relative degree of preference for that media-range, using the qvalue scale from 0 to 1 (section <a rel=\"xref\" href=\"rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.9\">3.9</a>). The default value is q=1. </p>\n<pre>      Note: Use of the \"q\" parameter name to separate media type\r\n      parameters from Accept extension parameters is due to historical\r\n      practice. Although this prevents any media type parameter named\r\n      \"q\" from being used with a media range, such an event is believed\r\n      to be unlikely given the lack of any \"q\" parameters in the IANA\r\n      media type registry and the rare usage of any media type\r\n      parameters in Accept. Future media types are discouraged from\r\n      registering any parameter named \"q\".\r\n</pre>\n<p> The example </p>\n<pre>       Accept: audio/*; q=0.2, audio/basic\r\n</pre>\n<p> SHOULD be interpreted as \"I prefer audio/basic, but send me any audio type if it is the best available after an 80% mark-down in quality.\" </p>\n<p> If no Accept header field is present, then it is assumed that the client accepts all media types. If an Accept header field is present, and if the server cannot send a response which is acceptable according to the combined Accept field value, then the server SHOULD send a 406 (not acceptable) response. </p>\n<p> A more elaborate example is </p>\n<pre>       Accept: text/plain; q=0.5, text/html,\r\n               text/x-dvi; q=0.8, text/x-c\r\n</pre>\n<p> Verbally, this would be interpreted as \"text/html and text/x-c are the preferred media types, but if they do not exist, then send the text/x-dvi entity, and if that does not exist, send the text/plain entity.\" </p>\n<p> Media ranges can be overridden by more specific media ranges or specific media types. If more than one media range applies to a given type, the most specific reference has precedence. For example, </p>\n<pre>       Accept: text/*, text/html, text/html;level=1, */*\r\n</pre>\n<p> have the following precedence: </p>\n<pre>       1) text/html;level=1\r\n       2) text/html\r\n       3) text/*\r\n       4) */*\r\n</pre>\n<p> The media type quality factor associated with a given type is determined by finding the media range with the highest precedence which matches that type.

If it is not possible to inform the user of all of the warnings, the user agent SHOULD follow these heuristics: </p>\n<pre>      - Warnings that appear early in the response take priority over\r\n        those appearing later in the response.\r\n</pre>\n<pre>      - Warnings in the user's preferred character set take priority\r\n        over warnings in other character sets but with identical warn-\r\n        codes and warn-agents.\r\n</pre>\n<p> Systems that generate multiple Warning headers SHOULD order them with this user agent behavior in mind. </p>\n<p> Requirements for the behavior of caches with respect to Warnings are stated in section 13.1.2. </p>\n<p> This is a list of the currently-defined warn-codes, each with a recommended warn-text in English, and a description of its meaning. </p>\n<p> 110 Response is stale MUST be included whenever the returned response is stale. </p>\n<p> 111 Revalidation failed MUST be included if a cache returns a stale response because an attempt to revalidate the response failed, due to an inability to reach the server. </p>\n<p> 112 Disconnected operation SHOULD be included if the cache is intentionally disconnected from the rest of the network for a period of time. </p>\n<p> 113 Heuristic expiration MUST be included if the cache heuristically chose a freshness lifetime greater than 24 hours and the response's age is greater than 24 hours. </p>\n<p> 199 Miscellaneous warning The warning text MAY include arbitrary information to be presented to a human user, or logged. A system receiving this warning MUST NOT take any automated action, besides presenting the warning to the user. </p>\n<p> 214 Transformation applied MUST be added by an intermediate cache or proxy if it applies any transformation changing the content-coding (as specified in the Content-Encoding header) or media-type (as specified in the Content-Type header) of the response, or the entity-body of the response, unless this Warning code already appears in the response. </p>\n<p> 299 Miscellaneous persistent warning The warning text MAY include arbitrary information to be presented to a human user, or logged. A system receiving this warning MUST NOT take any automated action. </p>\n<p> If an implementation sends a message with one or more Warning headers whose version is HTTP/1.0 or lower, then the sender MUST include in each warning-value a warn-date that matches the date in the response. </p>\n<p> If an implementation receives a message with a warning-value that includes a warn-date, and that warn-date is different from the Date value in the response, then that warning-value MUST be deleted from the message before storing, forwarding, or using it. (This prevents bad consequences of naive caching of Warning header fields.) If all of the warning-values are deleted for this reason, the Warning header MUST be deleted as well. </p>","type":"RESPONSE"},{"name":"WWW-Authenticate","example":"WWW-Authenticate: Basic","short-description":"Indicates the authentication scheme that should be used to access the requested entity","long-description":"<p> The WWW-Authenticate response-header field MUST be included in 401 (Unauthorized) response messages.
